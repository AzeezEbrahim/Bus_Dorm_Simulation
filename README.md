# Bus_Dorm_Simulation

# Introduction

This program simulates bus traffic in King abdulaiziz University.

# Project Description:

- Problem Definition?
      - The inefficiency Bus transportation system at King Abdulaziz University causes students to be late.
- Problem Solving?
      - Regulating the existing transportation bus system schedules/times by reducing wasted time.

### more details:
The current bus transportation system at King Abdulaziz University is inefficient and causes students to be late. This is because the bus leaves at a predetermined time, regardless of whether it is full or not. For example, if a bus is scheduled to leave at 7:15 AM and has a maximum capacity of 10 students, but 11 students arrive at 7:05 AM, one student will miss the bus because the next one is not scheduled to arrive until 7:15 AM.

To address this issue, we propose a solution in which additional buses are dispatched when the current one reaches maximum capacity during peak hours. This solution takes into account various factors such as fuel consumption, distance, time, and cost.

We plan to simulate both the current system and our proposed solution to compare their efficiency. This will allow us to determine the feasibility and benefits of implementing the new system.
